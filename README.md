# RayTracerCPP
#### Ray tracer in c++

This is the 2349th iteration of this project that I really like for some reason, in c++ this time.

To build the project and run the tests, clone it and then download google test from https://github.com/google/googletest.
Create the directory "lib" in the project root and put googletest-master in it.
